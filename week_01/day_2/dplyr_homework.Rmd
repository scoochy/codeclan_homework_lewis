This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Question 1:

```{r}
library(CodeClanData)

drinks_content
dim(drinks_content)
names(drinks_content)
```

Variables are above ^^ some are chr and some are dbl. Dimensions 242 x 18

Question 2:

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage, Beverage_category, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Calories))
  
```

Question 3:

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage, Calories) %>% 
  mutate(calorie_diff = Calories - 135) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_diff))
```

Question 4:

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage, Beverage_category, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_category) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean)) %>% 
  head(3)
  
```


```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage, Beverage_category, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_category) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean)) %>% 
  tail(3)
  
```

Question 5:

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage, Beverage_prep, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean)) 
  
```


Question 6:

```{r}
average_calories <- drinks_content %>% 
  summarise(av = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  pull()
  

drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage_prep, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  filter(Calories > average_calories) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Calories))
  
```

Question 7:

```{r}
drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage ,Beverage_category , Beverage_prep, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_category) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean))

drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage ,Beverage_category , Beverage_prep, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean))

drinks_content %>% 
  select(Beverage ,Beverage_category , Beverage_prep, Calories) %>%
  group_by(Beverage) %>% 
  summarise(calorie_mean = mean(Calories)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(calorie_mean))
```
